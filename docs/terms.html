      <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
      <p>
        By downloading, installing, or using the <strong>TapWater</strong> mobile application (the "Service"),
        you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you disagree with any part of the terms,
        then you do not have permission to access the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Purchases</h2>
      <p>
        Some parts of the Service offer additional features through in-app purchases. TapWater offers two upgrade tiers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pro ($4.99 one-time purchase):</strong> Unlocks multi-beverage tracking, custom drink types,
          entry editing and deletion, backdating, full history access, shift worker day boundary, home screen widgets,
          and Apple Watch support.</li>
        <li><strong>Insights ($1.99/month subscription):</strong> Includes all Pro features plus trend analytics,
          daily tags, CSV export, HealthKit sync, and custom themes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The Pro upgrade is a one-time purchase that does not expire. The Insights subscription is billed monthly
        through the Apple App Store. At the end of each billing cycle, your Insights subscription will automatically
        renew unless you cancel it through your Apple ID account settings.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Content and Data</h2>
      <p>
        Our Service allows you to create, store, and manage your personal hydration data, including drink entries,
        daily goals, and beverage preferences. As outlined in our Privacy Policy, this data is stored
        <strong>locally and exclusively on your device</strong>. You are responsible for maintaining backups of
        your data. We are not responsible for any loss of data.
      </p>
      <p>
        The app provides a <strong>"Delete All Data"</strong> feature in Settings that permanently erases all
        your local data. Because there is no cloud storage or backup system, <strong>deleted data cannot be
        recovered</strong> by you or by us. Use this feature with caution.</p>

      <h2>4. Limitation Of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. In no event shall the app owner be
        liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without
        limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from your access
        to or use of or inability to access or use the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Governing Law</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of your country of residence,
        without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
      </p>
